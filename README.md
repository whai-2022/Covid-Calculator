# Covid Calculator

Covid Calculator is an app that lets you know how safe a business is based on covid safety criteria.

This was our final project for Dev Academy's Web Development Bootcamp. You can see a [video of our presentation of this app](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THQNXGFnZdg) and there are some more screenshots of the app in the ['Visuals'](https://github.com/whai-2022/Covid-Calculator/tree/main#visuals) section below.

## The Team

We designed and built this app as a distributed team of four using using agile methodologies and collaborating remotely. A lot of the code was written through pair programming (also done remotely). In addition to coding, we all took on other team roles:

[Saffron Bush](https://github.com/saffron-bush) – Product Owner
[David Kavenga](https://github.com/david-kavenga) – Git Keeper
[Hannah Robinson](https://github.com/hannah-robinson) – Vibes Watcher, Git Keeper
[Hannah Victoria Robson](https://github.com/hannah-victoria-robson) – Scrum Facilitator

# Testing

We have a test coverage of 82% of our code.

## Technologies used

- React
- Redux
- Node.js & Express
- JavaScript (ES6)
- SQLite, PostgreSQL & Knex
- Chakra UI
- CSS3
- HTML5
- Auth0
- Mapbox
- Jest & Testing Library
- Webpack & Babel
- Git & GitHub
- Insomnia & Postman

## What's next?

If we'd had more time to work on this app, some of the things we would like to have added are:

- A form for businesses to create their own profile on the app
- Ensure users have to log in to vote on a business's reliability, limiting votes to one vote per person per business
- Make calculations for safety ratings more robust
